- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mickey-D3 AKA Mike

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning to use Linux on my new Asus Chromebook w/8GB RAM & 256GB            Memory. I am a beginner, 		 so please be helpful as well as patient with me.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... 

- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are: Get Bent

- âš¡ Fun fact: The 2020 & 2022 elections were rigged; Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself, and      neither did the Boing Whistleblower!
